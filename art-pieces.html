      <p>
        A <span class="item-name">Flower</span> in the
        <span class="main-title">Meadow of Wonders</span> represents an art
        piece accompanied with a short poem, it's <em>not</em> an actual flower. Each
        <span class="item-name">Flower</span> represents a state of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        They all lie within the <span class="main-title">Meadow</span>, which is
        the container of those different <q>wonders</q>. Each
        <span class="item-name">Flower</span> has a connection to the one that follows it. Together, they tell a story.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, I chose to present six <span class="item-name">Flowers</span>,
        which are the following:
      </p>

      <ol class="list-of-pieces">
        <li><a href="#art-piece-1">Strawberry's Symphony</a></li>
        <li><a href="#art-piece-2">The Wandering Whale</a></li>
        <li><a href="#art-piece-3">Lavender's Lullaby</a></li>
        <li><a href="#art-piece-4">The River of Oranges</a></li>
        <li><a href="#art-piece-5">The Shining Sunset</a></li>
        <li><a href="#art-piece-6">Dancing Dunes</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Click on a <span class="item-name">Flower</span> in the list above to
        check it out directly. However, I recommend checking them out first in
        order.

      <p class="poem">
        As one looks into themselves <br>
        They're first met with a storm of confusion <br>
        But as one begins to search more <br>
        They, at last, find their own desert <br>
        Dancing Dunes reveal who one truly is. <br>
        And as one listens to the symphony within, <br>
        Their transformation finally begins.
